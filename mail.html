        <h2>WHAT IS A POSTFIX SERVER ?</h2>
        <p>
            Postfix is a free and open-source mail transfer agent (MTA) that routes and delivers electronic mail, intended as an alternative to Sendmail MTA. Postfix is released under the IBM Public License 1.0 which is a free software license. The Postfix core consists of several dozen server programs that run in the background, each handling one specific aspect of email delivery. Examples are the SMTP server, the scheduler, the address rewriter, and the local delivery server.As an SMTP server, Postfix implements a first layer of defense against spambots and malware.

        <h2>HOW DOES SAMBA SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            The Postfix implementation uses safe subsets of the C language and of the POSIX system API. These subsets are buried under an abstraction layer that contains about 50% of all Postfix source code, and that provides the foundation on which all Postfix programs are built. For example, the "vstring" primitive makes Postfix code resistant to buffer overflow[5] attacks, and the "safe open" primitive makes Postfix code resistant to race condition attacks on systems that implement the POSIX file system API. This abstraction layer does not affect the attack resistance of non-Postfix code, such as code in system libraries or in third-party libraries.
