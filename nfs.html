        <h2>WHAT IS A NFS SERVER ?</h2>
        <p>

          The Network File System (NFS) is a client/server application that lets a computer user view and optionally store and update files on a remote computer as though they were on the user's own computer. The NFS protocol is one of several distributed file system standards for network-attached storage (NAS).NFS allows the user or system administrator to mount (designate as accessible) all or a portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file (read-only or read-write). NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to route requests between clients and servers.

        <h2>HOW DOES NFS SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            NFS begins with two computers which can speak TCP/IP to each other, most commonly over a Local Area Network, e.g. Ethernet.

One computer will be the NFS server: it offers up various chunks of disk storage (which is usually directly attached to the server system) to NFS clients that it can exchange TCP/IP packets with.

The other computer will be the NFS client: it will make a "mount" request of the NFS server, and subsequently make open/read/write/lseek/close requests of the NFS server on a per-file basis.
