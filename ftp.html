        <h2>WHAT IS A FTP SERVER ?</h2>
        <p>
          FTP is built on a client-server model architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client and the server.[1] FTP users may authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure transmission that protects the username and password, and encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (FTPS). SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is sometimes also used instead; it is technologically different.

        <h2>HOW DOES FTP SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            After connecting to the FTP server, you can use Auto FTP Manager's File Manager to upload, download and delete files.  Using the File Manager is a lot like working with Windows Explorer.
            FTP uses one connection for commands and the other for sending and receiving data.  FTP has a standard port number on which the FTP server "listens" for connections.  A port is a "logical connection point" for communicating using the Internet Protocol (IP).  The standard port number used by FTP servers is 21 and is used only for sending commands.  Since port 21 is used exclusively for sending commands, this port is referred to as a command port.
