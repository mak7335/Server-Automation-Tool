        <h2>WHAT IS A SAMBA SERVER ?</h2>
        <p>
            Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, and was originally developed by Andrew Tridgell. Samba provides file and print services for various Microsoft Windows clients and can integrate with a Microsoft Windows Server domain, either as a Domain Controller (DC) or as a domain member. As of version 4, it supports Active Directory and Microsoft Windows NT domains. Samba runs on most Unix, OpenVMS and Unix-like systems, such as Linux, Solaris, AIX and the BSD variants, including Apple's macOS Server, and macOS client (Mac OS X 10.2 and greater). Samba is standard on nearly all distributions of Linux and is commonly included as a basic system service on other Unix-based operating systems as well.

        <h2>HOW DOES SAMBA SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            How does Samba work? It uses Microsoft's SMB protocol (Sever Message Block). There are many other technical reasons on how this allows the two different operating systems to "talk" to one another, but thankfully you don't have to know all that to get Samba working on your own box. The details of the SMB protocol were never published by Microsoft. A group of people led by Andrew Tridgell worked and successfully was able to reverse-engineer the protocol. The early versions of Samba were built on this information.
