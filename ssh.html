        <h2>WHAT IS AN SSH SERVER ?</h2>
        <p>
            SSH is a protocol for securely exchanging data between two computers over an untrusted network. SSH protects the privacy and integrity of the transferred identities, data, and files. It runs in most computers and in practically every server. It ships standard on UNIX, Linux, and macOS machines and it is used in over 90% of all data centers in the world.
        </p>
        <h2>HOW DOES SSH SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            The SSH protocol works on the client/server-model. The SSH client always initiates the setup of the secure connection, and the SSH server listens for incoming connection requests (usually on TCP port 22 on the host system) and responds to them. In the connection setup phase, the SSH server authenticates itself to the client by providing its public key. This allows the SSH client to verify that it is actually communicating with the correct SSH server (instead of an attacker that could be posing as the server). After a successful authentication the server provides the client access to the host system. This access is governed with the user account permissions at the target host system. The secure connection between the client and the server is used for remote system administration, remote command execution, file transfers, and securing the traffic of other applications.
