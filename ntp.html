        <h2>WHAT IS A NTP SERVER ?</h2>
        <p> NTP time synchronization services are widely available in the public Internet. The public NTP subnet currently includes several thousand servers in most countries and on every continent of the globe, including Antarctica, and sometimes in space and on the sea floor. These servers support, directly or indirectly, a total population estimated at over 25 million computers in the global Internet. The NTP subnet operates with a hierarchy of levels, where each level is assigned a number called the stratum. Stratum 1 (primary) servers at the lowest level are directly synchronized to national time services via satellite, radio or telephone modem.

        <h2>HOW DOES NFS SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            A NTP server will provide the correct network time on your device using the Network time protocol (NTP). Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize the time on devices across a network. A NTP time server is used to obtain the correct time from a time source and adjust the local time in each connecting device. An NTP client gets time responses from an NTP server or servers, and uses the information to calibrate its clock. This consists of the client determining how far its clock is off and adjusting its time to match that of the server.
