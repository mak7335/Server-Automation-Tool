        <h2>WHAT IS A APACHE SERVER ?</h2>
        <p>
            Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is free and open-source cross-platform web server software, released under the terms of Apache License 2.0. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation. Most commonly used on a Unix-like system (usually Linux),[5] the program is available for Microsoft Windows as well. Version 2.0 improved support for non-Unix, e.g. Windows and OS/2 (and eComStation). Old versions of Apache were ported to run on e.g. OpenVMS and NetWare.

        <h2>HOW DOES APACHE SERVER WORK ?</h2>
        <p>
            Apache is a program that runs under a suitable multitasking operating system. The binary is called httpd under Unix and apache.exe under Win32[3] and normally runs in the background. Each copy of httpd/apache that is started has its attention directed at a web site , which is, for practical purposes, a directory. It is web server, the most popular web server available. web serverâ€™s job is basically to accept requests from clients and send responses to those requests. A web server gets a URL, translates it to a filename (for static requests), and sends that file back over the internet from the local disk.
